Don’t assume something when you can ask someone about it. Don’t look for an answer through other channels unless you’re convinced you’ll get higher quality information from those channels. Accept that you will not know this bit of truth unless it reveals itself to you. Treat the answer to the question as external to the decisions you have to make to get there. Act as if the great uncertainty that underlies life is irrelevant.

Asking for help, getting feedback, is an active process, and how you ask is just as important as what you ask. People, systems, and your relation to these people & systems change when you request information from them. Respect that.

Most people love giving advice, and especially love being thought of as an expert. You can flatter people by asking for help, and you should use this to your advantage. The trick is to maintain an internal confidence even when you realize how much you don’t know. If your affect is insecure, timid, and uneasy when you ask for help, you project that you believe you’re incapable of ever doing it right, and after enough time your mentor will start to believe this, too.

What you don’t know won’t hurt you, unless you kinda know what you should know but you avoid looking into it because:

- **You think it’s too hard:** It will point to more things you don’t know—more opportunities to learn & build mentor relationships)
- **You think you’re inadequate at a fundamental level:** This can’t be solved purely within work or school, and has probably trickled into other parts of your life. Cultivate meaningful personal relationships and mindfulness in your actions; also try therapy (another form of asking for advice).
- **You think you don’t have enough time:** Your time is an asset. If you think your time is fully invested in pursuits that offer maximum growth in all areas, e.g. material, intellectual, spiritual, and interpersonal wealth—then you’re fine. If you’re like the rest of us, you’ll need to work to get there. Reinvest your time accordingly. Cut off friends who don’t make you feel good about yourself over the long run. Fail classes with bad teachers, and go above and beyond with good teachers.

Your bank account, follower count, and GPA are secondary metrics that are linked to your underlying quality-of-life in an exceedingly complex way. They ARE NOT your quality-of-life.)

Your past achievements are not static, and should be examined from a multitude of perspectives that reflect the complexity of the decisions you had to make. There are several parts to an achievement:

“I had no choice” is something you might as well banish from your vocabulary. It undermines your credibility and deflects responsibility. If you have any responsibility, i.e. you are a decision-maker for a given situation, you always have some amount of choice. You might not have been the primary decision-maker, but focus on what you did have control over. “I had no choice” becomes “I faced a tough decision, and picked the lesser evil.” The choice is there and you always have the power to make it.
