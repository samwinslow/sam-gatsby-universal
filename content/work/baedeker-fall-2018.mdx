### Since August 2018, I have been the creative director of Baedeker, the NYU travel magazine. The magazine is published twice a year and consists entirely of student work: narrative content and photography. Students at our school are eager to share their experiences abroad, thanks  in part to NYU’s expanding global presence and  numerous study-abroad sites.

### I oversee a team of nine designers and three illustrators to produce this 36-page magazine once a semester. We also release web content on a rolling basis.
