This site is built with Gatsby.js, a static-site framework based around React and GraphQL. Some of its interesting features:
- No CMS; pages are generated from Markdown files
- Automatic deployment to samwinslow.net using Netlify
- Lazy loading of JPEG assets using `gatsby-image-sharp`
- Styled components to avoid large CSS payloads
