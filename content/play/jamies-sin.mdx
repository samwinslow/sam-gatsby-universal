## For a dark rap artist, visuals that play with light

### I created this title sequence for the song "Jamie's Sin," by Canadian rapper Night Lovell, as a personal project in late 2018. I recorded myself walking through the East Village, first with the camera pointed down at my feet; then, up to capture slight hints of objects in motion.

### You are not seeing an audio visualization per se. I did not know how I would process the footage when I began, but I was fascinated by the Lumetri Color scope in Adobe Premiere. You are seeing a moving histogram of found video footage, synced to the tempo of my walking speed as I listened to the song.

### For a rapper whose lyrics embrace drugs, lust, and the void, it seemed fitting to create low-fidelity imagery which blurs the auditory and visual senses.
